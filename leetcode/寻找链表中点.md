## 情况一
偶数时找后一个
奇数时找中间节点
```python3
slow, fast = head, head
node = head
while fast and fast.next:
  slow = slow.next
  fast = fast.next.next
mid = slow
```

## 情况二：
偶数时找前一个
奇数时找中间
```python3
slow, fast = head, head
node = head
while fast.next and fast.next.next:
  slow = slow.next
  fast = fast.next.next
mid = slow
```

## 情况三
偶数时找后一个
奇数时找后一个
```python3
slow, fast = head, head
node = head
while fast:
  slow = slow.next
  fast = fast.next
  if fast:
    fast = fast.next
mid = slow
```
